The response should focus on the difference between batch normalization and layer normalization, not the benefits of batch normalization.', 'answer': 'show with the help of batch normalisation we can grow several several records at once so with that in batch normalisation instead of creating loss function for each and every record and then adjusting the weights here here grouping few of the records finding the loss at once and then adjusting the weights so with the help of a loss function it would be much faster to go to the optimal local minima'}, {'question': 'What is the primary advantage of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks?', 'expected_answer': 'CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks because they can capture spatial hierarchies of features, allowing the model to recognize patterns and objects at multiple scales and locations.', 'question_type': 'technical', 'score': 30, 'feedback': "The response lacks clarity and coherence. The candidate seems to have some understanding of CNNs, but the explanation is confusing and contains errors (e.g., 'RPG format', 'extract weights from the image').
